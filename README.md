SVF is a static tool that enables scalable and precise interprocedural dependence analysis for C programs. SVF allows value-flow construction and pointer analysis to be performed iteratively, thereby providing increasingly improved precision for both. 

SVF accepts the points-to information generated by any pointer analysis (e.g., Andersenâ€™s analysis) and constructs an interprocedural memory SSA form so that the def-use chains of both top-level and address-taken variables are captured. SVF is implemented on top of an industry-strength compiler [LLVM](http://llvm.org) (version 3.7.0)

SVF contains a third party software package [CUDD-2.5.0](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/) (Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)), which is used to encode path conditions.

See SVF [homepage](http://unsw-corg.github.io/SVF/), [wiki](https://github.com/unsw-corg/SVF/wiki) and [doxygen](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~corg/svf/doxygen/) for details.
